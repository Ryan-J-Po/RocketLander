# RocketLander

This is a simple physics game where you play as an astronaut trying to land a rocket. Any kind of landing is okay, but some are better than others. 

The controls are simple - drag your mouse curso or mouse to a direction on the screen and press down. (Left-mouse click OR press down with your finger if on mobile.)

That's it! Enjoy.
